            <p>Indian indices are volatile on the back of global market clues along with fear of new coronavirus strain in the UK. 

                India and other countries have taken some steps to stop this virus from entering the country. We expect the market to be very volatile and VIX again at 25.16. 
                
                We suggest short-term traders be very cautious and trade only with stop loss.</p>
            <p>Market update: The market is witnessing a fresh wave of buying in most sectors. Barring BSE Energy, all sectors turned green with IT, Telecom and Teck rising over 2 percent each. BSE Metal, Utilities and Healthcare rose by a percent each. 

                Sensex was almost 300 points up at 45,853 and Nifty was 93 points up at 13,422 at 1410 hours.

            <b> A COVID-19 face-off: The day militias stormed Michigan’s capitol </b>
            <p>On April 30, 2020, hundreds of protesters, some affiliated with a wast array of armed right-wing militia groups, stormed the capitol building in Lansing, Michigan, demanding the resignation of Governor Gretchen Whitmer. </p>
            <p>
                The COVID-19 pandemic had been surging for just over a month and the state was under a stay-at-home order issued by the Governor. People were out of work, locked down in their homes and uncertain of what the future would hold. In the state, over 3,700 people had lost their lives to the coronavirus and 22 percent of the population was unemployed. When Governor Whitmer announced that she would be signing an order to extend lockdown restrictions even further, hundreds organized a protest to bring their frustrations to her door.

            <b>How to make the next election safer</b>
            <p>“We and other scientists have warned for many years that there are security weaknesses in voting systems and have advocated that election systems be better secured against malicious attack,” they wrote. “It is imperative that the US continue working to bolster the security of elections against sophisticated adversaries.”</p>
            <p>The panel ultimately selected voting computers known as Ballot Marking Devices from the vendor Election Systems & Software. Buell would have recommended the state pick a simpler system that used hand-marked ballots instead, which experts agree would have been safer and cheaper. </p>
            <p>
                The pair belong to the Election Verification Network, an invite-only group of interdisciplinary voting experts from around the country. Both agree that when states make choices about voting technology, people with technical expertise should be consulted to ensure their selections are sound.
