                NEW YORK – Report for America today announced the selection of 64 new local news organizations as host newsroom partners, enabling the national service program to place more than 300 journalists in the field next year. 
              </p>
              <p>The selections were made mostly on the basis of which newsrooms defined the most compelling gaps in coverage and plans to deploy corps members well. But the bottom-up approach did produce certain new patterns.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-6">
              <p>“With the local news system shrinking, it’s important that we both put more and more reporters in the field—and that we help newsrooms that are working toward becoming more sustainable, and more grounded in the community,”
              <p>“It’s particularly gratifying that newsrooms have, en masse, decided that they want to do better coverage of communities of color.”

                Those chosen include daily and weekly newspapers, digital-only news outlets, radio and television stations. </p>

            <p>Launched in April 2020, Usanii, the Swahili word for artistry, is a free magazine that features developing musicians, photographers, poets and more to raise awareness of their work and enable collaboration with established artists.

                The magazine founder, Lai from the Nairobi Hub, participated in October's Young Cultural Innovators Forum (YCI) and wasted no time in joining forces with fellow YCI members Xochitl Calix and Moira Villiard, from the Detroit and Upper Midwest USA Hubs respectively.
                “The whole idea of fundraising was really pushed by two YCI members, Xochitl and Moira,” he says. “They have been very instrumental in helping initiate what to look at and how to package the magazine. I have been reaching out to different YCIs from Europe, Australia, the US, Asia, and telling them about the magazine.”

              Anirudh Thapa, Chhangte, and Brandon Fernandes – some of India’s current international midfielders were all playing prominent roles for their team in the clash. But one clearly stood above the rest. Usually for the national team, Thapa
              has been deployed deep in the midfield and rarely ventures into the final third. But for this Chennaiyin team, Thapa is a genuine midfield kingpin.
